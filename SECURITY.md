# Security Advisory

## Current Status

This project has been audited for security vulnerabilities. The following issues have been identified:

### Development-Only Vulnerabilities (Moderate Severity)

The following vulnerabilities exist in development dependencies and **do not affect production builds**:

1. **esbuild** (<=0.24.2)
   - **Issue**: Development server can receive requests from any website
   - **Impact**: Development environment only
   - **CVE**: GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99

2. **http-proxy-middleware** (1.3.0 - 2.0.8)
   - **Issue**: Body parser failure handling
   - **Impact**: Development environment only
   - **CVE**: GHSA-9gqv-wp59-fq42

3. **webpack-dev-server** (<=5.2.0)
   - **Issue**: Potential source code exposure when accessing malicious websites
   - **Impact**: Development environment only
   - **CVE**: GHSA-9jgg-88mc-972h, GHSA-4v9v-hfq4-rm2v

### Risk Assessment

- **Production Impact**: **None** - These vulnerabilities only affect the development server
- **Development Impact**: **Low** - Requires specific conditions to exploit
- **Mitigation**: Use trusted networks and avoid suspicious websites while developing

### Resolution Plan

To fix these vulnerabilities, the following upgrade would be required:

```bash
npm audit fix --force
```

**Note**: This would upgrade Angular from v17 to v20, which is a major breaking change requiring:
- Code compatibility review
- Dependency updates
- Thorough testing
- Potential application refactoring

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Continue development as normal - production builds are not affected
2. **Short-term**: Consider upgrading to Angular 20 if project timeline allows
3. **Long-term**: Regular security audits and dependency updates

### Development Security Best Practices

- Use trusted networks for development
- Avoid accessing suspicious websites while running `ng serve`
- Regularly update dependencies during major releases
- Consider using `npm audit` as part of CI/CD pipeline with appropriate thresholds
